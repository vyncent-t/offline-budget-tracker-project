## BUDGET TRACKER

What is this app?
The goal of this app was to create a budget log that will store the name and amount of a transaction input by the uder that functions while offline in the browser using indexedDB.

What are the features of this app?
The user should be able to input the name and amount of a transaction to the client and refer to its logged state displayed dynamically on the client.
Alternatively the user is able to do the inverse, with cost or funds beings dynamically altered in the log below.
This should resemble something similar to a bank statement with transactions to and from the log.

This app was able to explore the browser kept data through indexedBD along with MongoDB and Mongoose.
